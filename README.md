# MobileManufacturing
A (closed-loop) 3D printing robot arm - 4 DOF - Arduino IDE (for demonstrative purpose) - 10x10x20mm walls.

The base code for kinematics are adapted from this website: https://www.circuitsathome.com/mcu/robotic-arm-inverse-kinematics-on-arduino/
TrossenRobotics also has great libraries and tutorials for kinematics.

The next step is to procure two robot arms (funds needed) and have them collaborate to create a simple (four-walls) structure. For more information or my ideas, email or message me!

This project was presented at 2017 MIT IEEE Undergraduate Research Conference and won 1st place at the State University of New York Senior Design Competition.
